## Normalized value restoration formula (normalized)

[
x = $-1$^{s}\times \big$1.f\big$\times 2^{,E-\text{bias}}
]

* $s$: sign bit
* $E$: unsigned value of the exponent field
* $1.f$: **implied leading 1** (leading 1, not stored), followed by 23 fractional bits
* bias: single=127, double=1023
## Illustration from your diagram

* The yellow highlighted part like
  [
  2^{-3}\times 1.001001\ldots
  ]
  is to separate the **exponent** ($2^{-3}$) and the **significand**: **1.(implied 1) + fraction**.
* "hopefully ≤ 23 bits" means: after normalization, we hope the significand fits in **23 bits**; if not, it needs to be **rounded**.

## A quick decoding example (float32)

Let the bit string be:
`s = 0`, `E = 1000 0001$=129$`, `fraction = 0100…0$=0.25$`
[
x = $+1$\times $1+0.25$\times 2^{129-127} = 1.25\times 2^{2} = 5
]
